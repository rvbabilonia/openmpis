    OpenMPIS
    ========

    OpenMPIS is the Open Source Missing Persons Information System. It addresses
    1.) the lack of a centralized service for disseminating advisories, 2.) the
    lack of a joint effort for finding missing Filipinos and 3.) the lack of a
    free and open source Missing Persons Information System.

    The purposes of this research are 1.) to implement an information system
    that will integrate and consolidate all government efforts in a.) finding
    missing, abducted, runaway, throwaway and abandoned persons and b.)
    reporting found and unidentified persons; 2.) to inform and encourage
    citizens to help look for these missing persons or abductors; and 3.) to
    promote awareness for the public in keeping their relatives safe.

    The target beneficiaries of this system are 1.) the proposed Missing Persons
    Council or Commission on Missing Persons, 2.) the Philippine National Police,
    3.) the National Bureau of Investigation, 4.) the Department of Social
    Welfare and Development, 5.) the missing and found persons, 6.) their
    relatives and 7.) the general public.

    OpenMPIS was developed by Rey Vincent Babilonia in partial fulfillment of
    the requirements for the degree Master of Information Systems from the
    University of the Philippines - Open University, Los Ba√±os, Laguna.
