Ma. Ysabelle Sim, a two year old girl was snatched while playing in the front of
their house' gate located in  336 Kaingin St., cor. Labores Extension, Pandacan,
Manila, Brgy. 858, Zone 93.  She's last seen wearing pink sando and white pajamas
on November 23, 2006
this tough story was aired on 'Sanay muling makapiling' by Jessica Sojo on QTV.
The program helped the grand mother, Ms. Gilda Sim, search for the little girl.
They roamed in Manila and Baclaran area.  Sadly, they did not succeed.
December 2007, the family was informed that 'Ysa' was found somewhere in Surigao.
This was indeed a good news, so the grand mother and her father named Jomar went
to the province.  Hoping to see the kid and be with her before Christmas.
Like a piece of bread, Maria Ysabelle Sim was allegedly sold to a childless
couple in Surigao del Sur. Ysa, now turning four found in the care of an adoptive family.

UNLAWFUL FLIGHT TO AVOID PROSECUTION - PARENTAL KIDNAPPING
ELIZABETH ANN STRATTON
Aliases: 	Elizabeth Ann Gould, Elizabeth Ann Mahon, Elizabeth Ann Pugh, Elizabeth Ann Smith, Beth Ann Smith, "Betty", "Beth"
Date of Birth Used:  	November 3, 1958
Hair: 	Blonde
Place of Birth: 	Inglewood, California
Eyes: 	Blue
Height: 	5'7"
Sex: 	Female
Weight: 	140 pounds
Race: 	White
Occupation: 	Lab Technician
Remarks: 	Stratton was a heavy smoker at the time of her disappearance. She may wear glasses. Stratton may have dyed her hair red or bleached it blonder. Stratton and her two children were all issued United States passports in August of 1997. She should be considered a flight risk.
THE CRIME
On December 16, 1997, Elizabeth Ann Stratton fled her Antioch, California, home with her two non-custodial children, then 9-year-old Zachary Stratton Smith and then 6-year-old Chelsea Paige Smith. On December 19, 1997, a letter written by Stratton arrived at the Contra Costa County District Attorney's Office stating that she had taken the children, left California, and did not want anyone to find her or the children. Stratton was in the middle of a child custody dispute with her ex-husband at the time.
Her vehicle was later found parked at the Sacramento International Airport in Sacramento, California. It is believed that Stratton and her children may have made contact with a group in Atlanta, Georgia, which assists women and children who claim to need protection from abusive husbands and parents.
A local complaint and arrest warrant for Stratton were issued by the Municipal Court in December of 1997 and she was charged with parental kidnapping. A federal warrant for Stratton for unlawful flight to avoid prosecution was obtained in the Northern District of California on January 12, 1998.

VICTIM - Zachary Stratton Smith
