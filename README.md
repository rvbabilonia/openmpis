OpenMPIS is the **Open** Source **M**issing **P**ersons **I**nformation **S**ystem. 
It addresses 1.) the lack of a centralized service for disseminating advisories,
2.) the lack of a joint effort for finding missing Filipinos and 3.) the lack of a
free and open source Missing Persons Information System.

The purposes of this research are 1.) to implement an information system
that will integrate and consolidate all government efforts in a.) finding
missing, abducted, runaway, throwaway and abandoned persons and b.)
reporting found and unidentified persons; 2.) to inform and encourage
citizens to help look for these missing persons or abductors; and 3.) to
promote awareness for the public in keeping their relatives safe.

The target beneficiaries of this system are 1.) the proposed Missing Persons
Council or Commission on Missing Persons, 2.) the Philippine National Police,
3.) the National Bureau of Investigation, 4.) the Department of Social
Welfare and Development, 5.) the missing and found persons, 6.) their
relatives and 7.) the general public.

OpenMPIS was developed by Rey Vincent Babilonia in partial fulfillment of
the requirements for the degree Master of Information Systems from the
University of the Philippines - Open University, Los Ba√±os, Laguna.

## For Developers

The latest branch can be cloned or downloaded from the [OpenMPIS Web site](https://github.com/rvbabilonia/openmpis).

### Architecture

OpenMPIS v2 shifted from the original monolithic architecture to a scalable RESTful microservices architecture. An 
embedded Apache Tomcat is now used to start all services. The relational MySQL database server has been replaced by 
the embedded non-relational Berkeley database Java edition. Apache Ant has been replaced by Gradle for dependency 
management and building. Apache Struts was replaced by Spring as the MVC framework.

OpenMPIS v3 is a complete overhaul designed to run on Amazon Web Services. The microservices now run as AWS Lambda
functions. Amazon DynamoDB is now the database service. Frontend is now using React. Other AWS services in use include
Route 53, CloudFront, API Gateway, S3, IAM, Certificate Manager and CloudFormation.

#### Modules
