[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.io/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Frvbabilonia%2Fopenmpis.svg?type=shield)](https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Frvbabilonia%2Fopenmpis?ref=badge_shield)

OpenMPIS is the **Open** Source **M**issing **P**ersons **I**nformation **S**ystem. 
It addresses 1.) the lack of a centralized service for disseminating advisories,
2.) the lack of a joint effort for finding missing Filipinos and 3.) the lack of a
free and open source Missing Persons Information System.

The purposes of this research are 1.) to implement an information system
that will integrate and consolidate all government efforts in a.) finding
missing, abducted, runaway, throwaway and abandoned persons and b.)
reporting found and unidentified persons; 2.) to inform and encourage
citizens to help look for these missing persons or abductors; and 3.) to
promote awareness for the public in keeping their relatives safe.

The target beneficiaries of this system are 1.) the proposed Missing Persons
Council or Commission on Missing Persons, 2.) the Philippine National Police,
3.) the National Bureau of Investigation, 4.) the Department of Social
Welfare and Development, 5.) the missing and found persons, 6.) their
relatives and 7.) the general public.

OpenMPIS was developed by Rey Vincent Babilonia in partial fulfillment of
the requirements for the degree Master of Information Systems from the
University of the Philippines - Open University, Los Ba√±os, Laguna.

## Requirements

You will need [Java 1.8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) or later to compile 
and/or run the application.

## For Developers

The latest branch can be cloned or downloaded from the [OpenMPIS Web site](https://github.com/rvbabilonia/openmpis).

#### Architecture

OpenMPIS v2 shifted from the original monolithic architecture to a scalable RESTful microservices architecture. An 
embedded Apache Tomcat is now used to start all services. The relational MySQL database server has been replaced by 
the embedded non-relational Berkeley database Java edition. Apache Ant has been replaced by Gradle for dependency 
management and building. Apache Struts was replaced by Spring as the MVC framework.

#### Modules

* openmpis-web-thymeleaf

    This module offers a new and improved Web interface using Thymeleaf natural templating engine. It retains the 
    look-and-feel of the original frontend.

* openmpis-web-angular

    This module sports a mobile-first single-page application (SPA) utilizing AngularJS.
    
* openmpis-rest

    This module exposes all applicable RESTful APIs and invokes the various microservices. It is being used by both 
    openmpis-web-thymeleaf and openmpis-web-angular modules. You can even create your own frontend.
            
* openmpis-eureka

    This module runs the Netflix Eureka server for service registration and discovery.
    
* openmpis-user

    This module handles the creation, modification and retrieval of users. It can authenticate users via LDAP or 
    OpenID. You can even implement other authentication mechanisms such as X.509 certificates.
    
* openmpis-person

    This module handles the creation, modification and retrieval of persons, relatives and abductors, if any.
    
* openmpis-image

    This module stores and displays the picture of the person. You can even introduce an age progression library.
    
* openmpis-case

    This module binds the encoder, investigator, person, relative and abductor, if any, into a single case.
